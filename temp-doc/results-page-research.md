# Results Page Research ToDos

Research items to determine the best UX decisions for the results page.

---

## ToDo List

### 1. Score Display Format
- [ ] **Determine if it's better to show main score or main range of score in results page**
  - Research: What do users prefer? Single number vs range?
  - Consider: Accuracy perception, anxiety reduction, clarity
  - Options to evaluate:
    - Single score (e.g., "650 puntos")
    - Range (e.g., "620-680 puntos")

### 2. Example vs Real Results Page Alignment
- [ ] **Determine if we need to align more the example result page with real result page**
  - Compare current example modal with actual results page
  - Identify differences in layout, information shown, styling
  - Decide if consistency helps or if differences serve a purpose

### 3. Next Mini-Clases Visibility
- [ ] **Determine if it's better to show the next mini-clases with no clicks required**
  - Current: User needs to interact to see next steps?
  - Option A: Show mini-clases expanded by default
  - Option B: Keep collapsed/hidden until user clicks
  - Consider: Cognitive load, motivation, conversion
