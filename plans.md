Arbor School - PreU

- MVP
  - Vision
    - Deliver a simple, mastery-based web app that raises PAES scores and gets students into target careers/universities.
    - North Star: % of students hitting target score by exam date.
  - Users & Goals
    - Primary: 4º medio students (and late 3º) targeting PAES.
    - Inputs: target careers/universities, target PAES date, baseline confidence, available study time.
  - Content Partnership
    - Source: Carez & Córdova (preguntas, solucionarios, guías y clases).
    - License: non-exclusive use; clear versioning; content update cadence.
    - Alignment: PAES blueprint; tagging to Knowledge Graph (KG).
  - Knowledge Graph (KG)
    - Nodes: atomic skills; edges: prerequisites.
    - Mastery rule: 90%+ accuracy on targeted checks ⇒ node mastered.
    - Evidence sources: diagnostic, simulations, targeted quizzes, practice history.
    - State per node: {Not started, Learning, Nearly mastered, Mastered} (using accuracy in most recent tests for this).
    - Decay/review: spaced repetition surfaces “Nearly mastered” before it decays.
  - Onboarding (frictionless)
    - Capture: name, course level, target careers/universities, target exam date, available days/wk & minutes/day.
    - Output: main dashboard + CTA to take initial diagnostic.
  - Dashboard (student home)
    - “Take Diagnostic” (first-run); else “Start Today’s Plan”.
    - Goal tracker: Current projected score vs required cutoffs per chosen careers.
    - Today’s plan: 3–6 items mixing “easy wins” + prerequisite gaps + quick review.
    - Streak/consistency widget (lightweight).
  - Diagnostics & Simulations (PAES-style)
    - Diagnostic (once at start; repeat optional after X weeks).
    - Full simulations: timed, blueprint-weighted; repeat anytime.
    - Outputs: total score, by-area, KG heatmap deltas, predicted next score range.
  - Mastery Plan Generator
    - Prioritization: EASY WINS FIRST (high impact, low effort, near-mastery nodes and easy nodes first), then prerequisite blockers, then broad review.
    - Methods: spaced repetition, interleaving, retrieval practice, mixed difficulty.
    - Plan sizing: auto-calc daily/weekly practice required to hit target by date (show “minutes/day” slider & effect on ETA).
    - Targeted tests: quick checks to confirm ≥90% on node clusters.
  - Practice Modes
    - Targeted (by node/cluster).
    - Mixed Review (SPACED).
    - Timed Sets (exam conditioning).
    - “Challenge me” (slightly above current level).
  - Progress & Reports
    - KG heatmap: mastered / nearly / learning / not started.
    - Next 3 Recommendations (why it matters + estimated score lift).
    - Trend: simulations over time; projected next simulation score.
  - Goals & Career Planner
    - University/career cutoffs: last-year “puntajes de corte” lookup.
    - Gap-to-goal: show delta points to each target; suggest weekly plan to close gap.
    - What-if: adjust practice minutes/day or days/week → see new ETA.
  - Data Integrations
    - Annual import: PAES university/career cutoffs (Chile).
    - Official trial dates/venues (if public): list + reminders.
    - Content ingestion: standardized item format + tagging to KG + difficulty.
  - Admin / Content Ops
    - Question Bank: item, solution, tags {KG-node, blueprint-area, difficulty}.
    - Versioning & quality flags; banned/duplicate checks.
    - Simple CMS for playlists/sets tied to KG clusters.
  - Feedback & Nudges
    - Smart reminders: “Finish Today’s Plan (12 min)” / “Retake quick check”.
    - Gentle gamification: streaks, mastery milestones; no noisy leaderboards.
  - Privacy & Compliance
    - Student data minimal; opt-in for reminders; export/delete controls.
    - Clear data usage for predictions and progress.
  - MVP Scope (ship this first)
    - Onboarding → Diagnostic → Dashboard with Today’s Plan.
    - KG engine (basic): node states, 90% mastery checks, easy-wins ranking.
    - Practice: targeted sets + mixed review + one full simulation.
    - Progress: KG heatmap + next-3 recs + simple goal gap.
    - Cutoffs: static last-year import (manual CSV ok).
    - Admin: basic item upload + tagging + set builder.
    - Reminders: email/push 1× daily configurable.
  - Metrics
    - Activation: % completing diagnostic in 48h.
    - Engagement: study minutes/week; plan completion rate.
    - Learning: nodes mastered/week; time-to-master; score increase per hour dedicated.
    - Outcomes: simulation score delta; % hitting target score by date.
    - Retention: weekly active; day-7/30 retention.
  - Risks & Mitigations
    - Content mismatch → tight blueprint mapping + QA passes.
    - Overcomplex UI → ruthless MVP; 1 clear CTA per screen.
    - Data uncertainty → show score ranges + confidence; don’t overpromise.
